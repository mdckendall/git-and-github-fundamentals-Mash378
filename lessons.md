By the reading the concepts in the readme I learned about pull requests, branches, repositories, and forks. 
Pull requests are a way of notifying other people to check the changes or the code created before commiting it to the main branch.
Branches allow us to work with a copy of the original file. Thus, we can make changes we want to make without affecting the original file. 
forks are another way copying a repository.
